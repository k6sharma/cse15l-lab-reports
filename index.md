   - The working directory when the command was run was the `home` directory
   - The `cd` command with no arguments takes us to the `home` directory automatically
   - The output is not an error

   ![Image](ls_no_arguments.png)
   - The working directory when the command was run was the home directory
   - The `ls` command with no arguments lists the contents of the working directory (which in this case is the `home` directory, and its contents included the `Lab1` file and the `lecture1` directory)
   - The output is not an error
